*   The St. Charles 708 Community Mental Health Board meeting was called to
order by Vice-Chair Rivard on January 22, 2025, at 5:30 PM. *   Present were
Denz, Litchfield, Muenz, Rivard, and Weddell; Poremba and Rosenberg were absent.
*   The meeting minutes from April 24, 2024, were approved. *   The board
discussed adding a question to the application rubric to categorize priorities
(direct services, support groups, etc.) to help remove bias and prioritize
applications, but concerns were raised about potentially downgrading scores or
reducing preventative funding opportunities; this topic will be discussed
further. *   A motion was passed to limit funding for first-time applicants to a
maximum of $10,000. *   The board discussed a PSA campaign to highlight agency
services and bring community awareness, but many members stated they do not have
the personal time currently. *   Weddell reported a reduction in opioid deaths
in Kane County in 2024, attributed partly to Narcan availability. *   The next
meeting is scheduled for March 19, 2025, as a pre-scoring meeting. *   The
meeting adjourned at 6:12 PM. *   Information was provided regarding ADA
compliance and how individuals with disabilities can request reasonable
accommodations to participate in public meetings.
